            A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with opposite 
            sides parallel (and therefore opposite angles equal). 
            A quadrilateral with equal sides is called a rhombus, 
            and a parallelogram whose angles are all right angles is called a rectangle.

            Learning basic HTML+CSS doesn't take long, but learning to use them well does take some time. 
            The basic tags and label can be understood in about one or two hours. 
            But if you want to learn advanced HTML and CSS animations, then it will take more time.
